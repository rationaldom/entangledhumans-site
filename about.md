Why the name **entangledHumans**? Because I'm a hopeless nerd and the ideas beind the word **Entanglement** happen arise in disparate areas of my life. Entanglement of humans in rope (Shibari or Kinbaku) is something I study and it is one of the themes I explore in my photography. Entangled is also a psychological state that two or more humans can find themselves in. No rope needed or implied. Why do people wind up entangled? Who knows? Finally, as a card-carrying PhD theoretical physicist, I am fascinated by entangled states particles and what these states say about the nature of physical reality. 

To be clear, there is no reason to believe in any deep connection between quantum mechanical entanglement and the two previous notions of entanglement. It's just artistic license and word-play people -- don't read to much into it.

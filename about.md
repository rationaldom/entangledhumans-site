Why the name **entangledHumans**? Because I'm a hopeless nerd and the ideas behind the word **Entanglement** happen to arise in disparate areas of my life. Rope bondage, as in Shibari or Kinbaku, literally entangles humans. Shibari is something I study and Kinbaku is a performance art that I appreciate.  Shibari is one of the themes I explore in my art and photography practice. Entangled is also a psychological state that two or more social beings can find themselves in. No rope needed or implied. Why do people become entangled? There are probably deep evolutionary reasons why social creatures become entangled. I have no understanding or insight, but I'm curious.  Finally, as a card-carrying PhD theoretical physicist, I am curious about entangled states of particles. These states say something deep about the nature of physical reality. What exactly they tell us is still poorly understood although there are hints of progress after 100 years of pondering by some of the smartest Physicist on the planet. I'm curious. 

TL;DR: there is no reason to believe in any deep connection between quantum mechanical entanglement, rope entanglement, and social entanglement. It's just artistic license and fun word-play -- don't read to much into it people.

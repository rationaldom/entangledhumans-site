Welcome to the **entangledHumans** project. **Entangled** refers to three distinct notions of entanglement: Entangled as in rope, entangled as in Quantum Mechanics, and entangled as in humans. We will explore whatever happens to grab our attention through photography, drawing, rope, and writing. Currently we're into photography. Click on the images below for selected work.

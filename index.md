Welcome to **entangledHumans**. The site is mostly about photography, drawing, and kinbaku. Myy collaborators and I will explore and opine on whatever happens to matter to us at the moment. The name of the site refers to three notions of entanglement: Entangled rope, Quantum Mechanical entanglement, and human entanglement. It can all get messy.
